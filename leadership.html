instead focus on building a team that assumes and anticipates turnover, including among senior leadership.  Trust, but verify, and hold people accountable for the decisions you empower them to make.</p><p><strong>Focus on a small number of must-win initiatives</strong>.  Execs must focus on the few things that no one else can do.  Delegate nearly everything that can be delegated to trusted managers and team members, except for matters relating to product, sales and services process, recruiting, outreach and developing business strategy.  Strong COO, CRO and CFO are at least as important as the CEO, CTO, or any other exec.  <em>Business leadership is a team sport.</em></p><p><strong>Modern Agile methodology = business agility.</strong>  Strong preference for transparency, asynchronous / distributed operations, results-oriented work environment (ROWE), investment in automation and systems integration.  Waterfall, at least in tech, is obsolete and the antithesis of business agility – a boat anchor slowing down innovation and frustrating the smartest minds in business.</p><p><strong>Actively partner with the world’s best companies.</strong>  The world’s most prominent technology companies can be incredibly powerful allies, advocates, and market evangelists.  Build the best GTM and strategic partnerships possible.  Invest heavily in these strategic relationships, and make sure they are consistently seen as a two-way street. </p><p><strong>You can have it done quickly, cheaply, or correctly. </strong>Pick two.  Especially in tech.</p><p><strong>Better, faster, and/or dramatically cheaper.</strong>  If you can't pick two, you are probably wasting your time on the wrong project.  </p><p><strong>Stand up for what you know to be right.  </strong>Even when it is hard, or expensive, or emotionally draining.  Few people ever live to regret fighting for what they believe in.  Many live with regret for not adhering to their own principles and taking the easy way out.  <em>Integrity matters.</em>  When you know in your heart what is right, follow your instincts and stay true to your values.  </p></div></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><div class="post__share-tag-container"><div class="post__share"><button class="post__share-button js-post__share-button icon" aria-label="Share button"><i class="fas fa-share-alt"></i></button><div class="post__share-popup js-post__share-popup"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Fleadership.html" class="js-share icon brands fa-linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">LinkedIn</span></a></div></div></div></footer></article></main><footer id="copyright"><h6><br><strong><span style="color: #3598db;">The opinions, artwork, and other content on this personal site are my own.</span></strong></h6><h6><strong><span style="color: #3598db;">They do not necessarily reflect the views of my employer.  </span></strong></h6><h6><br><span style="color: #236fa1;"><strong>All content and images copyright 2023 by the author.  All rights reserved.  </strong></span></h6></footer></div><script src="./assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=c9771cc3e90e18f5336eedbd0fffb2cf"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrollex.min.js?v=f89065e3d988006af9791b44561d7c90"></script><script src="./assets/js/jquery.scrolly.min.js?v=1ed5a78bde1476875a40f6b9ff44fc14"></script><script src="./assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="./assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="./assets/js/util.min.js?v=4201a626f8c9b614a663b3a1d7d82615"></script><script src="./assets/js/main.min.js?v=56233c354bd814758be8bff42f7e13a5"></script><script>/*<![CDATA[*/var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};/*]]>*/</script></body></html>
